#Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) Using edgeR

Differential expression analysis is used to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups by taking normalized read count data to identify genes that show statistically significant differences. 

There are different methods for differential expression analysis such as edgeR is based on negative binomial (NB) distributions. It is important to consider the experimental design when choosing an analysis method. While some of the differential expression tools can only perform pairwise comparison, others such as edgeR, can perform multiple comparisons.


##Objective 

A differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data by using edgeR performed  to compare samples from Psoriatic Arthritis patients to Healthy controls in order to identify deregulated genes whose expression levels are significantly different that helps to understand molecular mechanism of Psoriatic Arthritis, can lead to identify potential biomarkers for therapeutic targets.
